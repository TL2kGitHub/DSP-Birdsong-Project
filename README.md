# DSP-Birdsong-Project
This project was assigned to our class by our DSP (Digital Signal Processing) lecturer for the project section of the module in forth year. The project was worth 30% of the total module and is based on converting birdsongs and calls to spectrograms. I decided I would collect my own recordings around my localities. From there I converted my recordings to spectrograms and compared the birdsongs to one another.

## Final Grade Achieved: 1.1
